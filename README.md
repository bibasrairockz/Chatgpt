# GPT Language Model 🚀

A simple, PyTorch-based implementation of a **GPT-style language model** trained on character-level data. This project explores the basics of the Transformer architecture and generates text based on input context.

## Features ✨
- Transformer architecture with multi-head self-attention.
- Trainable on any character-level dataset.
- Generates coherent text based on input sequences.

## Setup 🔧

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bibasrairockz/chatgpt.git
    cd chatgpt
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install torch
    ```

3. **Prepare your dataset**:  
    Add a text file named `input.txt` for training.

## Training the Model 🏋️

Run the training script:
```bash
python gpt.py
