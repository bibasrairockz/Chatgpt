# chatgpt  
GPT Language Model 🚀
A simple, PyTorch-based implementation of a GPT-style language model trained on character-level data. This project explores the basics of the Transformer architecture and generates text based on input context.

Features ✨
Transformer architecture with multi-head self-attention.
Trainable on any character-level dataset.
Generates coherent text based on input sequences.
Setup 🔧
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/bibasrairockz/chatgpt.git
cd chatgpt
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install torch
Prepare your dataset:
Add a text file named input.txt for training.

Training the Model 🏋️
Run the training script:

bash
Copy code
python gpt.py
You can tweak model parameters like layers, heads, and embedding size inside the gpt.py script.

Text Generation 📝
After training, generate text using:

bash
Copy code
python gpt.py --generate
Example Output 🌟
